# Decentralized Birth Certificate System

This project aims to create a decentralized birth certificate system using **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** and **zk Rollups** on the **Internet Computer (ICP)** network. The system ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof records for birth certificates, leveraging blockchain technology to eliminate central points of failure.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Each birth certificate is tied to a DID, ensuring verifiable and privacy-preserving identification.
- **zk Rollups**: Used for scaling and privacy, allowing certificates to be verified without revealing sensitive personal information.
- **Smart Contracts**: Built with Motoko or Rust for managing birth certificate issuance and updates on the ICP network.
- **Frontend**: Developed with React.js (TypeScript) for web-based access, and React Native for mobile compatibility.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Birth certificate data is stored on OrbitDB to ensure data integrity and decentralization.
- **Cryptographic Security**: Utilizing `libsodium` for encryption, ensuring all personal data remains secure.
